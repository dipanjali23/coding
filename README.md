👋 Hi, I’m Deev (@dipanjali23)
👀 I’m interested in coding, cooking 🍳 and eating
🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, Web dev, Data science, and mastering Arch linux 🐧
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Cool web projects (think anime-theme, CSS wizardry, iframe hacks)
📫 How to reach me: DM on IG @deev_twist or just drop a winking face 😉 on Github, I'm always stalking my notifications!
😄 Pronouns: she/her
⚡ Fun fact: I believe ramen 🍜 is best than brain food! I've hacked my linux rig to boot in less than 5 sec (sometimes...😅) I binge anime during coding sprints (recommendations are welcome!) I use KDE for the aesthetics, but XFCE when I just want pure speed 😋😅 I think memes accelerate learning. Prove me wrong!
